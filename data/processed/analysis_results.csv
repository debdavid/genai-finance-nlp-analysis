All rights reserved.Introduction The motivation for this research is to provide an evidence-based understanding of public trust, attitudes, and experiences of AI, and expectations of its governance and regulation, as a resource to inform public policy and industry and government practice. Given the rapid advancement, widespread deployment and transformative impact of AI technologies, it is important to regularly examine public trust, attitudes, and expectations of AI. Equally important is documenting how people use AI technologies and experience the impacts of AI in their lives, work, and studies, and the implications this may have for organizations, education providers, and society at large. To date, there has been limited empirical insight addressing these critical issues, underscoring the relevance of this research in promoting human-centered AI that meets evolving societal needs and expectations. This is the fourth survey in our program of The Trust in AI research examining public trust and attitudes toward AI. Our current report examines the perspectives of over 48,000 people from Research Program 47 countries covering all global geographic regions, using nationally representative sampling of the adult population based on age, gender, and regional distribution. Taking a global perspective is crucial, given that AI systems are not bound by physical borders This study is the fourth in a research and are rapidly being deployed and used program examining public trust in across the world. AI. Each study has been designed Our program of research provided the unique to uphold academic rigor and opportunity to benchmark and compare the independence, whilst leveraging the findings in this report to our previous survey deep multidisciplinary expertise and data collected from 17 countries in late 2022, insight from KPMG.

The first focuses on AI use broadly in society examining the publics use, understanding, trust, attitudes and experience of AI systems and their impact on society. These insights are based on all respondents answering survey questions asked about AI systems in general, as well as AI use in the context of three common applications which are likely to be used by or impact many people generative AI systems, AI in healthcare, and AI in Human Resource applications. In the second section, we delve deeper into understanding how employees use and experience AI impacts in the workplace. In the third section, we examine student use of AI and their perceptions of how AI impacts education. Together, these sections provide evidence-based insights on the following questions  To what extent do people use and understand AI systems  To what extent do people trust and accept AI systems  How do people view and experience the benefits and risks of AI  What do people expect from the regulation and governance of AI  What are the key drivers of AI trust and acceptance in society  How is AI being used at work and with what impacts  How is AI being used by students and with what impacts The final section draws out the key conclusions and implications from these insights for industry, government, and the education sector.

Relevant differences are reported when statistically significant and meaningful. Correlational analyses and statistical models indicate associations between concepts and do not infer causality. Further details of the statistical procedures are discussed in Appendix 1. An overview of key indicators for each country sample are shown in Appendix 3. How changes in trust, use and attitudes over time were assessed To understand how trust, use, and attitudes toward AI have shifted over time, a selection of questions was asked in the same way in the 2022 and 2024 surveys. The 2022 survey included 17 countries Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, Korea, the UK, and the USA.17 While the samples collected in 2022 and 2024 are based on the same methodology and sample representativeness, they are independent of each other. As such, our analyses examine general trends rather than a longitudinal analysis of the same respondents over time.

To identify levels of AI literacy, survey participants self-reported their level of AI knowledge and efficacy together with AI-related education and training. They were also asked about their objective understanding of AI use in common technologies and interest in learning more about AI. In subsequent sections of the report, employees and students use of AI at work and for educational purposes are examined in more detail, together with organizational support for AI literacy. Public adoption of AI is high Two in This high level of adoption reflects the three people report intentional regular ease with which AI systemsparticularly use of AI tools for either personal, general-purpose generative AI toolscan be accessed and used by a diverse range work, or study purposes of people and applied to a broad variety of People were asked to report how often tasks.

Low levels of AI literacy may limit peoples ability to recognize the capabilities and applications of AI and thus fully realize benefits, and importantly, the ability to recognize the limitations of AI systems, critically evaluate their outputs, and guard against harm. For instance, social media users that are unaware of how algorithms shape content may fail to question the credibility or biases of algorithmically curated content and face increased vulnerability to misinformation and manipulation. The findings also reveal accelerated uptake of AI tools and higher levels of AI literacy amongst people in emerging economies compared to advanced economies. This may be explained in part by the increasingly important role that emerging and transformative technologies play in the economic development of these countries.19 As discussed in the next sections, people in emerging economies also tend to be more trusting, accepting, and positive about AI and experience the most benefits from its use, compared to those in advanced economies. 2025 The University of Melbourne.

They were also asked about the emotions they feel when it comes to AI applications. Our approach to measuring trust in AI aligns with the following common definition of trust a willingness to be vulnerable to an AI system e.g. by relying on system recommendations or output or sharing personal data based on positive expectations of how the system will operate such as accuracy, helpfulness, data privacy and security.20 People have more trust in the technical Trust is important because it underpins the ability of AI systems to provide a helpful acceptance and sustained adoption of AI. service but are more skeptical of its This is confirmed by our research trust is safety, security and impact on people associated with the acceptance and approval While most people use AI tools, many people of AI systems r.70 and the use of AI r.48. have reservations about the trustworthiness of People who trust AI systems are more likely AI systems and their use in society. to use them frequently.

All rights reserved.In summary Overall, the findings reveal considerable ambivalence toward the use of AI systems in society, stemming from the tension that people are less trusting of the safety and security of using AI systems and their impact on society, but are more trusting of their technical ability to provide a helpful service. This tension is reflected in low and ambivalent trust of AI, moderate acceptance, and the coexistence of optimism with worry, particularly for people in advanced economies. Moreover, trust in AI has declined over time, while worry has increased. The next section examines how this ambivalent trust is shaped by perceptions and experiences of the benefits and risks of AI systems. 2025 The University of Melbourne.

All rights reserved.How do people view and experience the benefits and risks of AI To help answer this question, we asked the extent to which people perceive and have observed or experienced beneficial or negative outcomes from AI, and if they feel the benefits of AI applications outweigh the risks. People expect and are experiencing 73 a broad range of benefits from AI Most people 83 believe the use of AI will result in a wide range of benefits, as shown in Figure 17. Importantly, 73 percent of people are personally experiencing or observing these benefits.25 are personally experiencing The most commonly expected benefits are or observing benefits of AI. also some of the most realized, with over three quarters reporting they have experienced or observed improved efficiency and effectiveness, reduced time spent on mundane or repetitive tasks and improved levels of accessibility to information or services.26 Increased fairness due to the use of AI e.g. by reducing human bias is the least commonly realized benefit, but it is still experienced or observed by over half of respondents 54. The utility of AI and peoples lived experience of its benefits help explain the widespread use, adoption and qualified acceptance of AI technologies, despite the trust concerns. The positive benefits experienced are largely performance orientedin line with our finding that people are more trusting of AIs ability to provide a helpful service and output. People who expect and experience or observe benefits from AI are more likely to trust r.42- .57, accept r.41-.63, and use AI r.40-.41. They are also more likely to have AI training or education r.25, AI knowledge r.31-.38, and AI efficacy r.38-.45. 2025 The University of Melbourne.

For example, depending on how it is implemented and for what purpose, AI systems can either increase fairness or augment bias, facilitate accurate information or contribute to misinformation, enhance what people can do or deskill people. As with all powerful technologies that augment capabilities and offer transformative opportunities for advancement and growth while also augmenting risks and negative outcomes, AI systems require careful management and governance, together with guardrails and guidance to ensure appropriate and responsible use and prevent harm. It is with this in mind that we turn next to examine the publics expectations of the regulation and governance of AI. 2025 The University of Melbourne.

We also explored who is trusted to develop and use AI, and the role of governance and assurance mechanisms in supporting trust in AI. Before presenting findings on public perceptions As shown in Figure 24, the majority of people in of AI regulation, it is important to recognize that all countries view AI regulation as a necessity. regulatory approaches vary significantly across India is the exception, where just under half 48 jurisdictions. For example, the European Union agree regulation is needed. In all other countries, has adopted the comprehensive EU AI Act, the percentage reporting that AI regulation is while other jurisdictions are at different stages needed ranges between 57 percent in the UAE of maturityranging from developing AI-specific to 86 percent in Finland. frameworks to relying primarily on guidelines This broad public consensus of the need to or existing regulation. This diversity highlights regulate AI supports the many national and the absence of a unified global approach and international efforts to regulate and govern AI to provides important context for interpreting minimize negative societal outcomes and harm. public perceptions of AI regulation. The majority in almost all countries surveyed believe AI regulation is required Given the perceived and experienced risks and impacts of AI, it is not surprising that 70 percent of people across countries globally believe AI regulation is required. Only 17 percent believe that AI regulation is not needed, with the remaining 13 percent unsure.

KPMG_2025_AI_Trust.pdf,KPMG,2025,AI_Trust,21,"The low level of public awareness of laws governing AI likely reflects that many jurisdictions are still in an early phase of designing and implementing regulatory frameworks. However, it also suggests a need to support people to understand if and how existing and emerging laws and regulation apply to AI. At the organizational level, the findings highlight that organizations can strengthen trust in their use of AI systems by putting in place governance and assurance mechanisms that signal trustworthy and responsible use. In the next section we further examine key pathways for supporting trust and acceptance of AI systems. 2025 The University of Melbourne.

To identify the most important predictors, we used a statistical technique called structural equation modeling.31 The model examines four distinct pathwaysreflecting knowledge, motivational, uncertainty, and institutional driverstesting and comparing their importance in predicting trust and acceptance of AI. We show the model in Figure 32, together with notes on interpretation.

The motivational pathway to trust is grounded As explained below, the model further shows that in evidence that the more people perceive trust acts as a central mechanism through which benefits, utility, and positive outcomes from other drivers impact AI acceptance. the use of technologies, the more they will be motivated to trust and accept them.34 AI literacy influences trust and acceptance Expecting AI systems to produce benefits The knowledge pathway is based on evidence B.23 has a relatively strong influence on that knowledge, efficacy, and trainingwhich trust, as well as on levels of acceptance B.22. each relate to AI literacyhelp to enhance trust This relationship highlights the importance of in technology.33 designing and using AI systems in a way that The model shows that people are more likely delivers benefits to a broad range of people. to trust AI systems when they believe they understand AI and when and how it is used in common applications and have received AI education or training B.11.

The values on the arrows indicate the relative importance of each driver in influencing trust and acceptance the larger the number, the stronger the effect. The positive values for institutional safeguards and confidence, benefits, and knowledge, indicate that when these drivers increase, so do trust and acceptance. The negative value for uncertainty indicates that when perceived risks increase, trust and acceptance decrease. The model is based on all data across countries and AI applications.

In support of this view, A notable finding is the extent to which there is a positive association between the employees report using AI at work in complacent extent employees feel strain at work and their and inappropriate ways see Figure 44. complacent use of AI r.31. Almost one in two employees who use AI admit While the survey was anonymous to encourage to doing so in ways that contravene organizational honest responses from the participants, these policies and guidelines. For example, about half findings may underreport the actual extent of 48-49 of employees report that they have complacent and inappropriate use of AI in the uploaded sensitive company information, such workplace, given social desirability bias.42 as financial, sales, or customer information, or copyrighted material, into public AI tools. Such 48 behaviors are most common of employees who report their organization has banned generative AI 67 or has a policy guiding generative AI use 56, compared to those in organizations without such policies 33 or those who are unsure if there is a policy 38. This suggests outright bans may be ineffective, and that simply having policies of employees report does not guarantee compliance clear guidance that they have uploaded and education on responsible AI use is needed. company information, Employees also report using AI in ethically such as financial, sales, ambiguous ways. Almost half 47 say they have used AI in ways that could be considered or customer information, inappropriate and even more indicate that they into public AI tools. have seen or heard other employees using AI tools in inappropriate ways 63. Fifty-six percent say they have used AI tools at work without knowing if it is allowed. Over half 57 of employees also admit that they have used AI in non-transparent ways, including presenting AI-generated content as their own or avoiding revealing when they have used AI tools to complete their work. This non- transparent use makes it even more challenging for leaders and managers to govern and manage employees use of AI at work. The complacent use of AI may also reduce the quality and accuracy of work. Over half 56 report they have made mistakes in their work from AI use. This likely reflects using incorrect or hallucinated AI-generated content from generative AI tools and may also include misinterpretation of AI recommendations or output. Two-thirds of employees report having relied on AI output at work without critically evaluating the information it provides 66 and putting less effort into their work due to AI 72. 2025 The University of Melbourne.

In advanced economies, just over half of thhat juast unlderf employees report that their organization has mechanisms in place to support AI adoption and responsible use, including a strategy and culture conducive to responsible AI adoption, adequate employee training, and governance processes. Only 55 percent believe there are adequate safeguards within their organization to ensure of organizations in advanced responsible AI use. While these findings are economies may be using AI based on employee perceptions and awareness without adequate support of these organizational support mechanisms, they suggest that just under half of organizations and governance. in advanced economies may be using AI without adequate support and governance. In contrast, in emerging economies, about 70 percent say their organization has a clear AI strategy, offers responsible AI training, and 65 percent report AI governance policies. Furthermore, 71 percent feel assured that sufficient safeguards exist for responsible AI use. This higher level of organizational support for AI aligns with the greater reported employee use of AI and higher levels of AI education and training, AI knowledge, and efficacy reported in emerging economies. These findings are based on employees who report working in organizations that are actively using AI. We anticipate considerably lower organizational support for responsible AI in organizations that are considering but have not yet actively taken steps to integrate AI into their operations. 2025 The University of Melbourne.

A majority of employees are intentionally using AI at work, and experiencing positive impacts, particularly performance and efficiency benefits. However, there are mixed effects from AI integration, particularly on workload, stress, and collaboration. Many employees are using AI in ways that are inappropriate or complacent, with organizational support and governance for responsible AI use perceived to be lagging, particularly in advanced economies. These factors, combined with the insight that most employees use free, publicly available generative AI tools in organizations that lack clear policies on its use, opens up substantial organizational risk. While most employees trust AI at work and accept its involvement in managerial decision-making, rapid adoption is reshaping workflows and deepening dependency on human-AI collaboration. In the final empirical section, we examine AI use by students who represent the workforce of the future. 2025 The University of Melbourne.

All rights reserved.Conclusion and implications The research insights from this global survey highlight the current and future opportunities and challenges of responsibly stewarding AI into work, education, and society. Our findings reveal rapid adoption of AI despite substantial public ambivalence toward its use. Although a clear majority recognize the technical competence, utility, and benefits of AI, fewer are assured of its safety and security, and many are concerned about the societal impacts. This ambivalence manifests in the cautious acceptance of AI coupled with limited trust, and optimism about its benefits coupled with worry about the risks.51 Underlying this ambivalence is the tension between realizing the benefits of AI and ensuring its responsible use. This tension is evident at multiple levels  At the societal level, governments seek to realize the national economic and productivity gains from AI and harness its potential to transform social services and address societal challenges, whilst also exercising their responsibility to protect societal values and safeguard citizens from harm and unfair treatment. Some jurisdictions view ongoing and significant investment in responsible AI as key to fostering competitive advantage.52  Citizens want to benefit from the promise of AI, while feeling safe and avoiding manipulation, fraud, privacy and IP loss, bias, and the damaging societal consequences of prolific mis- and disinformation. At the organizational level, leaders seek to realize enhanced productivity, innovation, value creation and competitive advantage from AI, whilst mitigating material and reputational risks and building sustained stakeholder trust. At the individual level, employees and students seek to enhance efficiency, quality and creativity in work and study, while avoiding deskilling, loss of jobs and the erosion of meaningful human connection. Some feel they have little choice but to adopt AI, fearing that not using it risks them becoming uncompetitive and left behind. This tension helps explain why the pace of AI proactive and sustained action and effort from adoption in the quest for performance gains has multiple actors at all levels. often outstripped AI literacy, training, governance, To help address this challenge, we draw out the and regulation. It is also why there is a public insights and implications of the research for key mandate for stronger regulation and governance groups at the forefront of AI adoption, integration, of AI, and growing desire for assurance of its governance and regulation. These include trustworthy use. government policymakers, regulators and citizens Effectively navigating this tension is one of the organizational leaders, managers and employees grand challenges of our time53 and will require and education providers and students. 2025 The University of Melbourne.

In biopharma, 57 of the value is found in RD and in sales and marketing. There are many routes to value. Chapter 3 explores how your company can efficiently find its most productive paths. BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP 9AI in Insurance and Biopharma At the business process, function, and use-case level, value creation from AI is already taking different directions in different sectors, highlighting the importance to each com- pany of independently identifying where its best opportuni- ties lie. Consider the evidence that our survey gathered in two very different sectors insurance and biopharma. The average AI maturity of both sectors falls in the middle of the maturity curve, not far off the all-sector average. Companies in both sectors generate an average of 70 or more of AI value from core business processes and 30 or less from support functions. But the similarities end there. Insurance Insurers are focusing on operations policy administration, underwriting, and claims management, customer service, and marketing and sales. See the AI factsheet for insur- ance. So far, the widest adoption of predictive AI at the individual-opportunity level has occurred in the areas of scoring, fraud assessment, and triage and policy automa- tion. Adoption of GenAI is strongest in the use of chatbots to resolve questions and summarize customer interactions. In line with their overall scores, insurers biggest challenges involve people and processes improving staff AI literacy, prioritizing opportunities over other concerns, and estab- lishing RoI for identified opportunities. They also wrestle with the tasks of integrating AI with existing IT systems and of increasing the accuracy and reliability of AI models. An Asian life and health insurance company with a strong track record in digital transformation sought to demon- strate the benefits that GenAI could have on its operations by identifying and executing a couple of high-impact, high- use cases.

However, the slow pace of implementation is creating significant delays in progress compared to other industries. 2 A careful balance of innovation and navigating risks will be crucial AI offers untapped potential for those that are willing to embrace change, but it also brings new and concerning risks that should be considered as organizations further develop their AI strategy. By undergoing an internal maturity assessment, organizations can have better clarity on current capabilities and identify areas to prioritize. Our tested maturity assessment framework enables organizations to do this effectively. 3 Successful organizations will likely still be data-driven and people-led Before starting on AI transformation, business leaders should have a clear and robust transformation plan in place, and focus on having a solid digital foundation and clean data to improve the output. Upskilling and empowering colleagues and teams to better understand the bridge between AI and data can support longer-term success, and provide additional value by leveraging AI as an assistant.

All rights reserved.Chapter insights  Firms are starting to identify potential benefits associated with AI and are introducing initiatives to investigate how this could be better utilized across the business. Many insurers are also looking at Gen AI use cases to drive efficiencies and productivity across finance and IT functions. Insurance organizations have made early progress with the adoption of traditional AI and machine learning techniques to develop advanced processes across internal functions and customer-facing services. Despite being early adopters of AI in some areas, there is a divide between leaders that are committed to further investment in this space, compared to others that may be more reluctant to spread significant use of AI through the business. Gen AI utilizes machine learning and deep learning Traditional AI relies on programmed rules and models such as natural language processing NLP focuses on analyzing, classifying, and predicting and computer vision technology to generate new outcomes based on existing data. content. Scientists have been attempting to program computers to mimic aspects of human intelligence for many decades. In 1958, the US Office of Naval Research demonstrated a perceptron, a five-ton IBM computer that learnt to distinguish between punch cards marked on the left or the right based on 50 initial cards for which it was given the answer. Systems with the ability to infer rules from input and output are now known as neural networks.3 Fast forward to today and AI has undergone a remarkable transformation, fueled by exponential advancements in computing power, data availability and cloud infrastructure. Seventy-two percent of large companies surveyed by KPMG in 2024 are currently piloting AI for financial reporting or using it selectively, rising to 99 percent planning to do so in the next three years.4 Workforces are also keen to explore the high-profile benefits of Gen AI. A recent survey of over 31,000 people across 31 countries published by Microsoft suggests that 75 percent of knowledge workers are already using Gen AI at work, with nearly half having started doing so in the last six months.5 Many insurance firms have already implemented machine learning or other AI solutions at an operational level to improve business processes. With enough training data, these algorithms can better analyze risk and predict outcomes, adding accuracy to risk models and pricing structures. These solutions are often developed to solve a specific problem, but there is an opportunity to quickly adjust for wider use across the value chain. Both Traditional and Gen AI could empower organizations to enhance actuarial models, deliver personalized insurance cover, or even increase the pace of insurance claims. But the process of doing so appears to be slow, with testing and implementation processes often taking several months to complete. Generative AI is expected to become a US1.3 trillion market by 2032.6 3 Melanie Lefkowitz, Professors perceptron paved the way for AI  60 years too soon, Cornell Chronicle, Cornell University, September 2019. 4 AI in financial reporting and audit Navigating the new era, KPMG International, April 2024. 5 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report, Microsoft and LinkedIn, 8 May 2024. 6 Generative AI to Become a 1.3 Trillion Market by 2032, Research Finds, Bloomberg.

By leveraging large language models and Gen AI-enabled NLP, organizations can support customer service processes by confirming identity through voice recognition, provide a timely response to online queries through use of chatbots, and generate more sophisticated next best actions for customer service agents through use of sentiment analysis and personalization.9 Deep-learning algorithms, such as NLP and computer vision technology, can also be leveraged to support and improve fraud prevention processes, by identifying whether an image has been modified or enhanced in a false claim, and being used to accurately predict category weather patterns so that pre-emptive measures can be taken. However, the output of these processes heavily rely on the quality of training data. This data used must be robust, accurate and able to flow across processes and systems.",james also kpmgs global technology help clients large scale gen ai proposition insurance transformation projects additional thank following insurance leaders interviewed kindly contributed towards insights shared within report davide consiglio alon ketzef country data officer founder chief executive officer generali italia passportcard italy israel anette bronder john kim chief technology operations officer chief data officer prudential plc zurich australia hong kong sar china advancing ai across insurance copyright owned one kpmg international entities kpmg international entities provide services clients rights contents current insurers landscape approaching ai transformation measuring navigating maturity associated ai adoption risks ai navigating leveraging ai closing associated risks assistant summary ai time act kpmg professionals help advancing ai across insurance copyright owned one kpmg international entities kpmg international entities provide services clients rights current landscape advancing ai across insurance copyright owned one kpmg international entities kpmg international entities provide services clients rights insights firms starting identify potential benefits associated ai introducing initiatives investigate could better utilized across business many insurers also looking gen ai use cases drive efficiencies productivity across finance functions insurance organizations made early progress adoption traditional ai machine learning techniques develop advanced processes across internal functions services despite early adopters ai areas divide leaders committed investment space compared others may reluctant spread significant use ai business gen ai utilizes machine learning deep learning traditional ai relies programmed rules models natural language processing nlp focuses analyzing classifying predicting computer vision technology generate new outcomes based existing data content scientists attempting program computers mimic aspects human intelligence many decades us office naval research demonstrated perceptron ibm computer learnt distinguish punch cards marked left right based initial cards given answer systems ability infer rules input output known neural fast forward today ai undergone remarkable transformation fueled exponential advancements computing power data availability cloud infrastructure percent large companies surveyed kpmg currently piloting ai financial reporting using selectively rising percent planning next three workforces also keen explore benefits gen ai recent survey people across countries published microsoft suggests percent knowledge workers already using gen ai work nearly half started last six many insurance firms already implemented machine learning ai solutions operational level improve business processes enough training data algorithms better analyze risk predict outcomes adding accuracy risk models pricing structures solutions often developed solve specific problem opportunity quickly adjust wider use across value chain traditional gen ai could empower organizations enhance actuarial models deliver personalized insurance cover even increase pace insurance claims process appears slow testing implementation processes often taking several months complete generative ai expected become trillion market melanie lefkowitz professors perceptron paved way ai years soon cornell chronicle cornell university september ai financial reporting audit navigating new era kpmg international april work trend index annual report microsoft linkedin may generative ai become trillion market research finds bloomberg advancing ai across insurance copyright owned one kpmg international entities kpmg international entities provide services clients rights organizations see ai insurance ceos important interviewed said would technology achieving take three five years ambitions gen ai provide return next three last two years surge new interest technologies due wide potential application benefits leveraging large language models gen nlp organizations support customer service processes confirming identity voice recognition provide timely response online queries use chatbots generate sophisticated next best actions customer service agents use sentiment analysis algorithms nlp computer vision technology also leveraged support improve fraud prevention processes identifying whether image modified enhanced false claim used accurately predict category weather patterns measures taken however output processes heavily rely quality training data data used must robust accurate able flow across processes systems,ai|insurance|gen|across|processes,Topic 0,0.9954,0.14446269416857654

All rights reserved.Industry perspectives At Generali, we have been using AI in production to support technical excellence for several years. For claims management, we have integrated AI across core capabilities, such as advanced tariff setting and smart process automation. The ability to identify specific content in claims paperwork and then rerouting this to the correct back-office function has resulted in greater accuracy and handling efficiency. Furthermore, AI is taking a front seat to enhance customer assistance. For example, around a third of our car policies are equipped with black boxes. When a car crash is detected, we lean on AI to contact the driver and assess their needs, before escalating to a human operator if required. Davide Consiglio, Country Data Officer Generali Italia At Prudential, we are using AI to accelerate processes across several insurance functions including distribution, call-centers, marketing, and HR. Our teams use AI technology to solve business challenges and to make our business more efficient. AI is likely to be a game changer for the insurance industry and is a critical part of our technology and data strategy. Our teams are already building some exciting applications of AI, but embedding data and AI across our culture must start at the top. As leaders, we need to identify what opportunities are available and help our people take advantage of those. To support this, we recently announced educational training on AI for all 15,000 colleagues across the organization, no matter their role. Anette Bronder, Chief Technology and Operations Officer Prudential Plc At Zurich Australia, we have been leveraging AI for some time. Teams have been utilizing optical character recognition OCR and NLP to enhance efficiency across back-office functions, and utilizing machine learning to optimize critical processes such as quality assurance and pricing models. While our AI adoption has historically been focused on tailored, bespoke solutions, we are committed to exploring scalable applications to further enhance our capabilities. This includes what we call human-automated risk management, a process in which the underwriting teams receive all the datapoints needed to underwrite risk with little-to-no time spent looking at documentation.

Anette Bronder, Chief Technology and Operations Officer Prudential Plc We have a three-pronged approach at Zurich Australia. Firstly, we are looking at our delivery teams to identify and adopt solutions from current software partners where appropriate. A second stream looks at the strategic problems we want to solve where we own the intellectual property, such as automated decision-making, which we are not going to outsource, given the potential impact to customers. Finally, we want to use copilot platforms to improve productivity, not just with our technology team, but to also support frontline workers. John Kim, Chief Data Officer Zurich Australia Advancing AI across insurance 15  2024 Copyright owned by one or more of the KPMG International entities. KPMG International entities provide no services to clients. All rights reserved.AI Spotlight Client perspective PassportCard Many insurers dabble with AI across processes, but PassportCard relies on it to control claims, manage fraud, and personalize marketing. The Israel-based medical insurer provides a payment card to customers, for use across covered treatments in more than 200 countries and territories, avoiding the need to claim retrospectively. PassportCard combines an extensive medical database and AI to set financial boundaries for the costs of medical services based on type and location, adjusted daily, allowing it to pay around 95 percent of its US250 million of annual claims automatically. Its systems escalate the remaining 5 percent for review by staff, providing the chance to get involved while customers are undergoing treatment rather than days or weeks afterwards. Alon Ketzef, PassportCards Founder, says that the financial boundaries system would not be viable without AI, as it uses millions of data points. It was launched in 2011 based on 12 years of data from a predecessor health insurer for expatriates You cannot launch this solution without the database, otherwise it would be shooting in the dark, he says. AI is as good as your data. PassportCard also uses AI for fraud detection, with every customer scored and unusual behavior flagged for staff review, as well as for more than 70 administrative processes. More recently, the company has started using AI to personalize digital sales by recommending services based on destination, length of trip, family size, ages, and previous patterns of use. The insurer also provides members with real-time notifications across 15 key risk categories that could impact their travel or safety over the following 24 hours. Ketzef says that discrimination from profiling represents AIs greatest risk. For example, a system could identify families from certain nationalities as being likely to make higher claims because they usually have more children than average. PassportCard uses staff checks to guard against such dangers We have to run some sanity checks to make sure that we do not discriminate, he says. Given a lack of practical regulation, the company has decided that if an AI decision could damage a customer, such as refusing cover or a claim, this decision must be checked by a human. It might be mathematically the right decision, but from societys perspective it is not right, says Ketzef. KPMG in Israel is working with PassportCard to make the company future ready, given the accelerating speed of technological progress. For example, Ketzef says it recently implemented a new optical character recognition service able to handle multiple scripts including Chinese and Arabic as well as handwriting, but while doing so, a rival launched a product that could also analyze writer sentiment. He wants to move towards implementing ideas within 30 days of conception, including through use of plug and play technology services that do not require lengthy integration work. Ketzef believes the next big opportunity involves machine to machine interactions where customers rely on digital assistants to make purchasing decisions. These digital assistants can consider thousands of options, potentially allowing PassportCard to win business in any market where it is authorized, without conventional marketing. However, this will mean coping with greatly increased volumes of automated enquiries and performing strongly on whatever measures such assistants use, which Ketzef thinks are likely to focus on quality as much as price.

KPMG firms have developed a sophisticated AI maturity assessment model that measures organizations based on six pillars. The model includes a visual representation of progress, allowing for easy comparison with other organizations or industry averages. Undertaking such an assessment can enable organizations to prioritize and then accelerate their efforts in developing AI. 47 of insurance organizations have invested strategically to integrate AI across core business capabilities. These organizations have AI use cases running actively across the organization and are returning business value, compared to the global average of 43.11 How ready is your organization to scale AI Its easy to sometimes get caught up in the excitement of new technologies and disruptive solutions. For insurance organizations, a successful AI transformation should start with a step that can often be overlooked an honest, internal assessment of functional capabilities. And this is where the KPMG insurance AI maturity assessment can help. Based on collective member firm experience working with clients around the world, this framework can help to identify priority actions and accelerate progress.

All rights reserved.Industry perspectives The insurance industry is typically a slow adopter, for the right reasons sometimes. If I were in the shoes of an established insurer, I would establish a new operation that is born using cloud and AI and put in a CEO who will manage it side-by-side with my organization. Then, when it gains momentum, I would move pieces of the old business into the new business. I am afraid that any other approach with incremental improvements here and there is not going to move the needle at the speed needed. Alon Ketzef, Founder and Chief Executive Officer PassportCard A number of wider industries, for example telecommunications, have been quicker to adopt data strategies. This may be because organizations faced a lot of disruption a few years ago, and leaders had to pause and experiment with innovative solutions. Within insurance, we are still discussing whether it is a good thing to use AI in specific areas such as call centers, while telco providers have been using this many years. We have to understand the importance of data to our business, and the pace at which it can be implemented.

This placed additional strain on agents to provide accurate and comprehensive information quickly to customers relating to their products and coverage, and threatened to impact overall customer service quality. AI specialists at KPMG in Israel stepped in to help streamline operations and improve efficiency. The team developed a customer-centric self-service platform an AI-driven solution that connected customers with access to clear and concise information about their policies, including details on coverage, without the need to wait for an agent. The self-service solution not only addressed the immediate challenge of call capacity but also laid the foundation for a more efficient contact center operation. This enhanced the customer experience by providing instant access to the information needed and eliminating long waits to deliver a seamless experience. By empowering customers to self-serve, the insurer simultaneously reduced the volume of calls handled by the contact center, and staff became available to focus on more complex and valuable tasks, boosting productivity and morale, alongside customer satisfaction.

This can be addressed through improved data quality, transparent and explainable AI systems and governance. Gen AI creates enhanced and new risks over confidentiality and data protection. Using Gen AI services that keep data within organizations and training staff on safe use can help tackle these. Training and running Gen AI models require significant computational power, leading to a large carbon footprint and high energy consumption. Organizations should be aware of these potential impacts and implement sustainable practices, exploring energy-efficient AI solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of Gen AI and align on ESG commitments. While the opportunities aligned with AI are significant the associated risks are also increasing, with challenges impacting every corner of the organization. These include bias and discrimination, confidentiality and trust issues, regulatory risks, environmental impact, and workforce relations. However, avoiding AI altogether can also expose insurers to the risk of missing out on potential opportunities and benefits and losing competitive advantage. Risks associated with traditional AI For insurance organizations, data discrimination is one challenge associated with traditional AI technologies. These systems are designed to look for correlations between sets of data, which can help to improve the accuracy of risk and pricing based on customer information. Pricing based on characteristics such as sex or race is illegal in some jurisdictions, and unacceptable in others. Insurers in the EU have been barred from setting premiums based on sex since 201213 while New York States Department of Financial Services recently published guidance designed to protect consumers from AI-based discrimination by insurers.14 Excluding sensitive data may not solve the problem, with the tendency of location data to act as a proxy for ethnicity, involved in redlining exclusion of

Data lakes and other technical approaches can enhance quality, but there are often more fundamental issues. AI software that is trained on a library of decisions by humans that date back several decades to obtain sufficient material may absorb historical biases as a result. These issues can be addressed by increasing the transparency of AI models to understand how they produce their results, a concept called explainable AI, something increasingly mandated by regulations such as the EUs GDPR.

Insurance organizations can help customers to proactively improve their risk profiles, such as through vehicle telematics or through advice on how to reduce vulnerability to cybercrime. Enhanced reinsurance strategies can also improve the pooling of risk. AI is a powerful tool but it comes with real risks, from biased data to regulatory hurdles and environmental impacts. Its important that organizations develop a robust AI governance framework to help navigate these challenges. Were seeing more and more companies aligning their practices with leading frameworks like ISO 42001 and the EUs AI Ethics Guidelines and building a library of risks and controls tailored to both their own needs and external standards. Its about ensuring that AI is used ethically and responsibly, without stifling innovation. Mark Prichard Director, Technology Consulting KPMG China Industry perspectives In addition to the well-known risks related to AI ethics, GDPR compliance or to AI-enhanced cyberattacks, we are also investing in the quality of internal data. AI systems utilize the input dataset without judgement to the quality itself, and this is used throughout the process, all the way through to the deliverable. AI systems cannot yet decipher whether the data is accurate or clean. It doesnt yet have the ability to handle a conflict in the information. And these issues could result in inaccurate information being passed onto agents or customers. This is a serious issue, and highlights the need for robust data quality and data governance frameworks. Davide Consiglio, Country Data Officer Generali Italia Data governance and AI governance is an ongoing focus with leadership and the board. Technically you can monitor models for drift, and look at data coverage and scope to make sure you are not creating biases with the data you use to train models  but ethical use of the outcomes requires ongoing review.

All rights reserved.Regulatory risks Use of AI can impact compliance with regulations beyond data protection laws. For example, the UK requires financial service providers, including insurance firms, to check that marketing for a product is clear, fair and not misleading before approving it for publication.20 This becomes significantly more complex with AI-driven personalized marketing, where messaging may be unique and potentially subject to the EU GDPR consent requirements. Regulation of AI is set to be a fast-moving area, with the introduction of the European Union EU AI Act in August 2024, and other jurisdictions developing similar Regulatory frameworks. 70 of CEOs believe that the lack of current AI regulation within the insurance industry could become a barrier to organizations success.21 Environmental impact AI also needs to feature in organizations environmental and sustainability considerations. The substantial computing required for AI processes raises concerns around its environmental impact, and subsequent ESG regulatory and reputational risks. The International Energy Agency has estimated that electricity required for data centers, AI and cryptocurrencies could double between 2022 and 2026 to reach the equivalent of Japans total electricity consumption.22 In July 2024, Google said its greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 were 48 percent higher than in 2019, partly due to increases in data center energy consumption to support AI services.23 Such impacts can be partially addressed by monitoring energy use and prioritizing less intensive AI models for certain applications. Key takeaway The insurance sector has a reputation for stability and caution, but avoiding use of AI due to the risks is itself a risky decision. Its important that organizations are aware of all AI risks and put in place the appropriate mitigation frameworks to fully maximize the positive opportunities. 20 ICOBS 2.2 Communications to clients and financial promotions, Financial Conduct Authority UK. 21 KPMG Insurance CEO Outlook, KPMG International, December 2023. 22 Electricity 2024, International Energy Agency, January 2024. 23 Google Environmental Report 2024, Google, July 2024.

Anette Bronder, Chief Technology and Operations Officer Prudential Plc KPMG Case study Building a secure and scalable AI foundation utilizing real-world data with Beazley Beazley, a leading specialist insurance group based in the UK, set out to enhance operations across the business and develop a solution to assess new AI services. However, the team faced a significant challenge to build a robust and secure technical infrastructure capable of handling real-life data, compared to test data, to help develop accurate and reliable models. Insurance professionals across KPMG in the UK collaborated closely with the client to design and implement landing zones pre-configured cloud computing accounts designed to integrate with Beazleys existing technology, security protocols and networking policies. By streamlining the deployment process, Beazley could rapidly integrate and test new AI services then adapt these to meet business needs before deployment. The solution also ensured that all applications adhered to stringent security and compliance requirements, and could be developed in a safe environment.

Many employees have expressed a demand for AI, and business leaders are looking for a suitable path forward. Organizations see an opportunity to streamline processes, but believe there will continue to be a need for human interaction. A customer has returned home with their family to find it has flooded while they were away. They cant stay there, and their possessions are damaged. It is at a time like this that insurance providers in-the-moment support is needed more than ever. Considering a scenario like this quickly leads us to several ways in which AI and related technologies could provide a fast, loyalty-earning response for customers over the next few years, and many are already underway. One option is to automate the claims process when an insured event occurs, in this case a residential flood. Through a data-sharing agreement with the local emergency services, the insurer can swiftly record that one of its insured properties had suffered severe damage and apply an AI-based assessment to identify if further enquiries are needed before making an interim payment.",expanding pool employees believe help identify overcome challenges davide consiglio country data officer generali italia

In this case, a high level of certainty that an insured property had experienced severe flood damage would trigger an interim payment within minutes of the emergency services logging the incident. AIs increasing use to support more complex tasks offers an opportunity to drive significant value across the organization. However, it also raises concerns around its impact on the workforce. Leadership teams can help by presenting services as virtual assistants that help people to work more efficiently and accurately, rather than replacing them. A humans in the loop approach is often desirable as it provides human supervision of AI systems to help ensure that the technology is delivering the expected outcomes and help to identify when the technology is failing. It is also important that insurance firms consider how to operate if AI systems do fail, which would be likely to require human operators to step up.

All rights reserved.Industry perspectives AI can be used to create seamless touchpoints with customers, bring more intelligence to our data, create end-to-end views and help to reskill our people. If we do that in a smart way across operational functions, it could free up a lot of time for our people to concentrate on products, services and how we serve our customers. It could help insurance, especially operations, to move away from firefighting and fixing things, to concentrate on service excellence and a much better customer experience. Anette Bronder, Chief Technology and Operations Officer Prudential Plc From a risk perspective, we will have humans in the loop as we implement AI solutions. In a couple of years time, for example, we should not have the need or processes to perform manual data entry, consolidation or aggregation of information.

All rights reserved.Many insurers have already automated some customer processes such as sales and claims through online forms, chatbots and other digital agents. The next few years will likely see AI further improving the abilities of automated agents to satisfy routine customer requirements, and potentially remove the need for form submissions altogether. Currently, these processes work reasonably well until customers have questions or requirements that are out of the ordinary, at which point it is common for the technology to give up and hand the process over to humans. Insurers could therefore benefit from using technology to recognize when a fully-informed human agent should take over and make this a near-seamless process. More broadly, AI could allow insurers to create blended products covering a range of needs in one policy, including new types of cover for autonomous vehicles or digital nomads who frequently move location, providing financial security in a wide range of situations. In short, AI could allow these businesses to reinvent themselves, by combining the best of both artificial and human intelligence to offer new levels of service for those they protect. Key takeaway Look for ways of implementing AI to streamline processes and enhance support for customers in their greatest moments of need. Remember that AI works best when it is supporting and augmenting people and processes  not replacing them. Keep a human in the loop, and build staff engagement and confidence through clear communication and education around AI. Develop AI adoption guidelines, including expected benefits and risks, in order to help ensure widespread support and controlled adoption across the organization. Dont forget that AI is not a universal panacea  different customers will continue to have different needs.

All rights reserved.Industry perspectives Given the significant pace of the change in the last two years from a technological, social, and economic perspective, it is difficult to predict where we will be in 10 years from now. However, there are some key financial and demographic trends that I believe will impact the insurance industry, and potential AI applications. For example, we have an ageing population which increases the demand for long-term care, not only for financial aid but with physical assistance. Advancements in this space could lead to the development of robots assisting, or co-assisting, the elderly as an additional service. Another important consideration that could change the demographic trend trajectory in our country, is the flow of immigration. This has the potential to support the ageing population and reshape the customer base. However, adapting to this shift in customer base and demand for insurance products will likely require a rethink in strategies, and to ensure our AI models are retrained to accurately respond. Davide Consiglio, Country Data Officer Generali Italia For many insurers, its time to close the gaps and fix the bleeding. Organizations should create a common understanding of vision, develop data governance on use of information across data repositories and data lakes, and build an AI mindset through training of the workforce.

While AI adoption is underway across insurance, the pace of progress needs to accelerate in order to fully harness the power of transformation. The ability to identify existing strengths and address capability gaps will likely play a critical role in paving the way for a successful, structured AI integration which can serve and enhance key parts of the organization, not just isolated processes. Its important that insurers take a balanced approach towards their AI journey  the ability to identify and mitigate risks while proactively exploring the technologys true potential could open the door to new products and services that better respond to customer needs. And quickly. Insurers no longer have the benefit of time to develop, test and discuss the use of AI  they need to make rapid progress in order to keep momentum and respond to customer needs. By leveraging our AI maturity assessment, leadership teams can quickly identify core capabilities and prioritize use cases. And by combining human ingenuity and AI capabilities with robust safeguards, insurance organizations could unlock a new dimension of innovation and redefine the art of the possible. The greatest risk in the age of AI Failing to act at all. Its time to think big, start small and scale fast. Key considerations for insurers 1 Organizations need to have accurate and reliable data in place before building AI models. Running AI on inaccurate data can lead to serious problems, risking reputation and regulatory pressure. As the strategy is developed, leadership teams should look to define AI goals and identify priority use cases to create short term return and momentum. Start with a clear view on 2 current capabilities across the six key pillars identified within our AI maturity assessment. Try to ensure this is supported with a clear governance structure, to manage and monitor progress and compliance. This should also include review mechanisms covering output and reliability, flagging concerns and confirming processes are followed in line with agreed guidelines. 3 Aim to ensure teams have the right technology and ability to integrate this into current processes and system landscape to deliver the best outcome. Confirm you have the people and skills in place before setting out. 4 In order to navigate risks including the potential bias of systems, a structured testing and validation process is key to continuously assess the results of AI systems within specific use cases, identify positive outcomes and benefits, and resolve any problems. 5 Communication is critical. Confirm that you have the right people and strategy in place, and that this is communicated across both key stakeholders and the wider business. Communicating the use of AI as an assistant can help successful integration and provide clarity on the future of roles.

KPMG_2025_AI_IDC.pdf,KPMG,2025,AI_IDC,0,"IDC MarketScape IDC MarketScape Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Services 2025 Vendor Assessment Jennifer Hamel Reid Sherard THIS EXCERPT FEATURES KPMG AS A LEADER IDC MARKETSCAPE FIGURE FIGURE 1 IDC MarketScape Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Services Vendor Assessment Source IDC, 2025 July 2025, IDC US52978525eSee the Appendix for detailed methodology, market definition, and scoring criteria. ABOUT THIS EXCERPT The content for this excerpt was taken directly from IDC MarketScape Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Services 2025 Vendor Assessment Doc  US52978525. IDC OPINION This IDC study represents a vendor assessment of the 2025 worldwide artificial intelligence AI services market through the IDC MarketScape model. This is the fourth iteration of this assessment, and IDC last assessed this market in 2023. With each iteration, we have revised our evaluation criteria and buyer perception survey instrument to refine our assessment methodology and reflect market evolution. Much has changed in the AI market in the two years since the previous IDC MarketScape assessment on worldwide AI services published, just a few months after ChatGPT captured public consciousness. Potentially transformative enterprise GenAI use cases dominated conversations across industries throughout 2023, and this excitement contributed to the technology rapidly gaining C-suite attention and investment support. In 2024, organization encountered many obstacles to scaling their AI initiatives, such as internal skills gaps, excessive implementation difficulty and cost, misalignment of use case priorities and stakeholder needs, and poor data access and quality. IDC research indicates that, in 2025, organizations are looking to pivot from endless experimentation and pilot projects toward scaled, production-grade AI deployments. Effective AI adoption and scaling require addressing a range of business and technology challenges. IDC has identified critical building blocks in setting up the foundation for an AI-fueled business, which includes an AI-fueled operational plan unifying strategy, governance, and workforce development, as well as an AI-ready technology operating model for applications, AI platforms, data, and infrastructure. The rapid emergence of agentic AI in recent quarters adds further complexity to organizations AI strategies. As AI techniques continue to advance, addressing the fundamental building blocks of AI, adoption remains critical to progressing out of endless experimentation cycles. Organizations continue to rely on trusted services partners with deep expertise, collaborative engagement approaches, and dependable delivery capabilities to drive ROI and business value from AI investments. IDC research shows that strategic support with project prioritization, effective coordination between IT and line-of-business teams, and access to the right developer skills and effective tools are key success factors enabling organizations to achieve the highest levels of success with their AI initiatives. 2025 IDC US52978525e 2We continue to observe AI services vendors succeeding in the market by both clearly articulating their strategies for enabling clients adoption of AI solutions and readily demonstrating their current capabilities and proof points through existing client engagements. We also note that the services industry is undergoing its own transformation due to AI infusion. Resilient and forward-looking vendors are updating best practices and applying lessons learned from their internal AI efforts to help clients navigate adoption and scaling challenges and to deliver desired outcomes more quickly and efficiently. In this assessment, IDC evaluated AI services vendors across scoring criteria based on information provided in writing and through extensive briefings by participating vendors. IDC also collected feedback from customers on their perception of the key characteristics and the capabilities of these vendors. Key findings include  The most critical vendor attribute for successful AI services engagements, according to IDCs Artificial Intelligence Services Buyer Perception Survey, remains ability to achieve business outcomes. The perceived priority of this attribute over all others was unchanged from the 2023 study. When buyers were asked about the top business objective driving their engagement of their artificial intelligence services vendor, at a worldwide level, the most frequent responses were increased operational efficiency, faster innovation, and cost savings. Thirty percent of the buyers we surveyed reported they achieved 30 or greater improvement in measurable KPIs from their AI services engagement. The top-rated vendor attribute, in aggregate, was the ability to integrate vendor project team with internal team. Again, the highest satisfaction rating for this vendor characteristic is consistent with findings of the 2023 study. IDC MARKETSCAPE VENDOR INCLUSION CRITERIA This research includes analysis of AI services providers with global scale and broad portfolios spanning IDCs research coverage of the AI services market. In determining the group of vendors for analysis in this IDC MarketScape, IDC considered the following set of inclusion criteria  Worldwide AI services revenue of at least 500 million over the past calendar year  AI services revenue generated in each major geographic region i.e., Americas, EMEA, and AsiaPacific  AI services offerings spanning the life cycle of business and IT services e.g., project based, managed, support, and training 2025 IDC US52978525e 3 AI services offerings addressing a range of industry verticals and business functions  Offers its own software assets e.g., tools, platforms, or other proprietary solutions as part of AI services portfolio  Go-to-market alliances with a range of AI technology providers ADVICE FOR TECHNOLOGY BUYERS  Maturity assessment. Consider your organizations strategy and business objectives before selecting any technology. Just because GenAI and agentic AI currently dominate technology and business conversations does not mean that these capabilities are the right solutions to your business problems, or that your organization is ready to take full advantage of them. A good partner will work with you to understand your goals and challenges, first, and then will help you evaluate whether and when you can expect to realize business benefits from AI investments, considering your available talent, data, and technology resources. AI-fueled business operating plan. Becoming an AI-fueled organization will require integrating AI into your business strategy, focusing on impactful AI use cases, establishing unified governance, and planning for an AI-augmented workforce. If these are areas where you need support, look for providers with approaches that include business transformation consulting, ROI and business value analysis, responsible AI and governance frameworks, workflow reengineering to support human-AI collaboration, and resources for reskilling and enabling employees.",idc marketscape idc marketscape worldwide artificial intelligence services

KPMG_2025_AI_IDC.pdf,KPMG,2025,AI_IDC,1,"Seek out partners that can translate between technical and business concepts to align stakeholder priorities and expectations and can also communicate effectively with your employees through workshops and change management programs. AI technology operating model. Cost-effective and secure scaling of AI capabilities across an organization requires a unified technology approach that incorporates fit-for-purpose infrastructure AI-ready data a platform integrating data, model, and software development life cycle activities and AI-infused applications and workflows. If your organization is early in its transition to this type of approach, seek out providers with expertise in AI technology foundations and reference architectures, computational resource optimization, data modernization, platform engineering, and design, prototyping, and industrialization of AI applications. If your AI technology operating model is more established, choose providers that can integrate seamlessly with your environment and internal teams and help you optimize deployment efficiency. Skills. The range of expertise needed to operate as an AI-fueled organization continues to evolve rapidly. Adoption of agentic AI technologies will inevitably 2025 IDC US52978525e 4create new job roles and skills requirements for organizations and services providers alike. Select a partner with skilled resources and platform certifications that fill gaps or enhance your existing AI capabilities, integrate well with your internal teams, and can flex as your skill needs change. Consider partnering with a services provider through an AI center of excellence COE construct to gain ongoing access to best practices and recommendations, innovation and RD resources, on-demand AI talent pools, and managed services and support to move AI solutions from experimentation into production. Innovation and accelerators. Experimentation will remain a necessary part of the journey to becoming an AI-fueled organization. Services partners can provide structure, organization, and insight to reduce innovation risks and deliver more predictable and tangible outcomes. To accelerate moving from proof of concept to production, consider services vendors that both partner with your chosen technology providers and have codified their own domain knowledge and development methodologies into repeatable blueprints and design patterns. Also, consider the proprietary software assets that service providers may propose as part of their AI services offerings to augment products from your technology provider ecosystem andor automate business, IT, or operations workflows. While a providers prebuilt solution may only address 6080 of your organizations needs, it may be a better option than a fully customized solution, especially for more common use cases. Vendor selection. Use this IDC MarketScape in contract negotiations and as a tool to not only short-list vendors for AI services bids but also evaluate vendors proposals and oral presentations. Make sure you understand where these players are truly differentiated and take advantage of their expertise, technical, industry base, or otherwise. VENDOR SUMMARY PROFILES This section briefly explains IDCs key observations resulting in a vendors position in the IDC MarketScape. While every vendor is evaluated against each of the criteria outlined in the Appendix, the description here provides a summary of each vendors strengths and challenges. KPMG After a thorough evaluation of KPMGs strategies and capabilities, IDC has positioned the company in the Leaders category in this 2025 IDC MarketScape for worldwide AI services. KPMG uses a three-phased-maturity model Enable, Embed, and Evolve to maximize AI value creation for clients by providing a structured approach to implementation and 2025 IDC US52978525e 5growth at the foundational, functional, and enterprise layers. Offerings within the firms AI services portfolio are designed to support clients wherever they are on their journey, from addressing barriers to AI adoption e.g., KPMG AI Strategy, KPMG AI Workforce, KPMG AI Trust, and KPMG AI Data and Technology to accelerating the client journey KPMG AI Jumpstart to transforming clients business with AI KPMG AI Transformation. KPMG has committed to investing 4.2 billion over the next three years in the firms own transformation, including expanding its alliances, embedding AI across KPMGs product and service portfolio, and creating new function- and industry- specific AI solutions. KPMG has created a companywide development platform, called Workbench, that houses its core AI capabilities and powers its multiple client-facing AI services platforms, including Velocity for advisory, Clara for audit, and Digital Gateway for tax. Velocity has been a major focus for the company over the past year, including incorporating AI agents along the firms five-stage maturity model, with knowledge assistants and taskers released now for audit, tax, and select functions automators in limited release and collaborators and orchestrators in development. Trust plays a central role in KPMGs AI services value proposition, with governance and responsible AI embedded in the Workbench layer, as well as across the firms offerings. KPMG is also evolving its commercial structure toward service-as-a-software and subscription- based contracts to accommodate new AI services operating models. Strengths IDC considers KPMGs strategies related to offerings, delivery model, alliances, and innovation and RD, as well as its breadth of AI services offerings, to be key strengths. Customers have regard for the firms ability to provide customer service particularly onsite, offer flexible pricing models, manage key stakeholders, and provide knowledge transfer to nontechnical end users. Challenges IDC believes KPMGs marketing strategy could be improved by addressing a broader range of themes and organizational levels including managers and end users with the firms marketing messages for AI services. KPMG could also benefit from more investment in platform certifications across its AI services practice. APPENDIX Reading an IDC MarketScape Graph For the purposes of this analysis, IDC divided potential key measures for success into two primary categories capabilities and strategies. 2025 IDC US52978525e 6Positioning on the y-axis reflects the vendors current capabilities and menu of services and how well aligned the vendor is to customer needs. The capabilities category focuses on the capabilities of the company and product today, here and now. Under this category, IDC analysts will look at how well a vendor is buildingdelivering capabilities that enable it to execute its chosen strategy in the market. Positioning on the x-axis, or strategies axis, indicates how well the vendors future strategy aligns with what customers will require in three to five years.",seek partners translate technical

KPMG_2025_AI_IDC.pdf,KPMG,2025,AI_IDC,2,"The strategies category focuses on high-level decisions and underlying assumptions about offerings, customer segments, and business and go-to-market plans for the next three to five years. The size of the individual vendor markers in the IDC MarketScape represents the market share of each individual vendor within the specific market segment being assessed. IDC MarketScape Methodology IDC MarketScape criteria selection, weightings, and vendor scores represent well- researched IDC judgment about the market and specific vendors. IDC analysts tailor the range of standard characteristics by which vendors are measured through structured discussions, surveys, and interviews with market leaders, participants, and end users. Market weightings are based on user interviews, buyer surveys, and the input of IDC experts in each market. IDC analysts base individual vendor scores, and ultimately vendor positions on the IDC MarketScape, on detailed surveys and interviews with the vendors, publicly available information, and end-user experiences in an effort to provide an accurate and consistent assessment of each vendors characteristics, behavior, and capability. Market Definition IDC defines artificial intelligence AI as systems that learn, reason, and self-correct. These systems hypothesize and formulate possible answers based on available evidence, can be trained through the ingestion of vast amounts of content, and automatically adapt and learn from their mistakes and failures. AI systems use a variety of technology components across hardware e.g., AI servers, AI storage, AI infrastructure as a service, AI network, and AI devices and software e.g., AI platforms, AI-enabled applications, and AI system infrastructure software. IDCs definition of AI includes three broad categories of capabilities generative, predictive, and interpretive. AI services providers engage with clients to help deploy and use AI systems through business services and IT services 2025 IDC US52978525e 7 Business services include AI-related business consulting and business process outsourcing services. IT services include IT consulting, systems and network implementations, IT outsourcing, application development and management, IT deploy and support, and IT education and training related to AI applications and infrastructure spending. Underlying data services are a critical component of creating AI systems, serving as the base for initial analysis and learning. Data services are highly specific to the function and process of the AI system and may come from a wide range of sources, both unstructured and structured. These data services include the processes needed to ingest, organize, cleanse, and utilize the data within AI-enabled applications. For detailed definitions of the markets included within business services and IT services, see IDCs Worldwide Services Taxonomy, 2025 IDC US52282025, March 2025. Customer Perceptions of AI Services Vendors A significant and unique component of this evaluation is the inclusion of the perceptions of AI services buyers of both the key characteristics and the capabilities of the vendors evaluated. The buyers participating in IDCs 2025 Artificial Intelligence Services Buyer Perception Survey have partnered with at least one of the participating vendors directly on an AI services engagement within their company. The survey findings highlight key areas where buyers expect AI services providers to showcase a range of capabilities. The buyers consider these capabilities a must-have for AI services to be able to fulfill the requirements of many business and IT issues that challenge the buyers. Figure 2 illustrates the order of factors important for a successful AI services engagement for the AI services customers surveyed in 2025. Survey findings suggest that the ability to achieve desired business outcomes business, operational, or technical by the consulting and delivery teams working on an AI services engagement is the most critical factor for the successful completion of the engagement. Customers also indicated the quality of AI skills and knowledge, the quality and accessibility of data for value-driven use by AI models, prioritization or co-development of relevant AI use cases, and technical insights and competency to be among the most critical attributes for an engagements success. 2025 IDC US52978525e 8FIGURE 2 Top 10 Factors for Successful Artificial Intelligence Services Engagements, 2025 Q.

Make the Difference. KPMG International kpmg.comNavigatingAIinAuditForeword AI is transforming financial reporting and auditing. They are often seen as time-consuming and monotonous exercises, requiring statistical sampling methods and manual checking of financial data. Further, the human ability to work with big data has been a severe limiting factor, preventing the broad connection of various data sources from working out deeper insights. But AI is changing that  helping businesses create smarter and more joined-up information flows with better identification and response to risk and a much greater ability to detect anomalies and outliers. Larry Bradley How far will this go Is the vision of an interconnected AI-powered financial reporting ecosystem, with value-added and Global Head of Audit predictive insights, a near reality  or still a far-off aspiration KPMG International Our research conducted amongst 1800 financial reporting executives across major economies around the world shines a new light on these key questions  and finds that we are standing on the cusp of a genuine financial reporting revolution moving from the digital age to the AI age in which nothing will ever be quite the same again. While there are hurdles to be overcome  notably around accuracy and security  the benefits that could be reaped in the areas of insight generation, trend and anomaly detection, risk control, and data-enabled decision making could power us into a new era where financial reporting is smarter and better than we have ever seen before  all subject to laser-focused and Thomas Mackenzie highly granular AI-enabled auditing processes. Companies need help navigating this change, but with a human touch. Global Audit Chief Technology Officer KPMG International Companies also expect their auditors to lead the AI transformation and inspire and drive the transformation of financial reporting.

We are using AI to power our audits and transform the audit experience, while at the same time recognizing the inherent complexities and potential risks that accompany such advancements. This journey is firmly rooted in a foundation of ethical conduct and responsible practices, guided by our space Trusted AI Approach. This framework serves as an anchor, aligning KPMG firms services with core values Sebastian Stöckle while championing principles of transparency, explainability, fairness and accountability. Head of Innovation, Global Audit KPMG International We are also investing in extensive training and support for our audit professionals as they increasingly spend time both assessing clients AI processes and utilizing more AI tools and enablers in the audit itself.

At the same time, the use of AI is translating into greater productivity for the financial reporting team, combined with higher talent acquisition and skills development. Over 4 out of 10 companies already report greater employee productivity and efficiency, and in three years the percentage will grow to 6 out of 10. Similarly, the percentage of companies citing that AI will help their companies attract financial talent rises from 36 percent now to 47 percent in three years. Enhancing skills increases from 32 percent to 42 percent and filling staff shortages from 27 percent to 36 percent. These benefits accrue over time. Leaders enjoy many more benefits than other companies, particularly for predicting trends 65 percent, increased data accuracy 57 percent, and lower costs 52 percent. They also expect more benefits over the next three years. Since it is still early days, only 33 percent of companies see high or very high value in the use of genAI for financial reporting. They see greater value in more traditional AI, where they have made the most progress. The biggest value-driver is anomaly detection 65 percent, followed by RPA 58 percent, machine learning 58 percent, deep learning 53 percent, and natural language processing 50 percent.

Agents dont sleep. As agents become exponentially more capable in their reasoning and Once agents have automated a set of tasks, they can be instructed to ability to collaborate, they can automate tasks, roles, and processes run these around the clock every day, as long as there is energy, data, that could previously only be performed by humans. This expands and human supervision available. Just by doing the same work for 24 the share of work that can be freed up for human talent, but also the hours, instead of 8, an organization can improve daily productivity by effectiveness of the work over time. Specifically, after automation, three times. When multiple agents are working simultaneously, they can agents can be instructed to continuously strive to optimize their also accomplish tasks faster than a human team could. If the agentic interactions toward a specified goal. team can do the same work, say in 13 of the time, the organization can deliver nine times more work per 24-hour day. This can also make the organization more agile, by responding more rapidly to trends that occur during off hours. For example, in manufacturing, agents can manage production lines by optimizing schedules and workflows and perform predictive maintenance to reduce downtime. When supply disruptions occur, procurement agents find alternatives, while production agents reconfigure schedules automatically. 2025 KPMG LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Agents convert knowledge into action. Once a process has been automated by a swarm of agents, it also Although GenAI can significantly enhance productivity, the potential becomes easier and faster to adopt this workflow to ever-changing value from agentic AI can be much greater due to its ability to convert circumstances over time. The agents are trained and motived to knowledge into coordinated action. As organizations deploy multiple deliver specific outcomes but dont need detailed instructions on agents, they need to feed them the right knowledge to drive the most how to proceed or to take time away from delivery to get trained. In effective outcomes. This requires systematically capturing and structuring addition, they are not threatened by change, nor are they reluctant the tacit expertise that typically resides only in employees minds, making to collaborate, hence they require less change management. The it available for the agents use. For example, in retail store performance agentic workflow can iterate and accommodate experimentation audits, audit agents continuously monitor store operations data, customer faster to get to an optimal outcome within the guardrails of their feedback, and store sales, flagging compliance issues and performance instructions. This can be a critical advantage in, for example, financial anomalies across locations. This occurs while agents automatically services, where month-end close agents identify anomalies and generate corrective action recommendations for regional managers. prepare journal entries, reducing close cycles. At the same time, vouching agents automatically cross-reference invoices against contracts, purchase orders, and receipts, flagging discrepancies without manual review. If reporting policies, organizational structure, or lists of customers and suppliers change, the agentic system automatically adjusts the end-to-end process. 2025 KPMG LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

The introduction of agentic AI is changing this dynamic. By embedding AI agents into the unique workflows and tasks of different roles, organizations can realize much greater adoption, acceptance, and utilization. By taking the time now to envision the impact of agentic AI on the organization, companies can better manage the necessary shifts in roles, skills, and workforce structure. This Even given agentic AIs relative ease of use, some employees may be reticent foresight will help organizations cope with the magnitude of change and increase the to work side by side with AI agents. In a recent KPMG AI Pulse Survey, 45 chances of gaining a competitive edge. of respondents said their employees were resistant to change. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a robust change management program that considers the impact of AI agents on team dynamics, morale, and a culture of collaboration and innovation. Further, it is important to communicate that integration of AI agents Codify the ways you work. into the workforce is not about replacing human jobs it is designed to enhance the Human activities can be divided into structured work, which follows standardized processes with clear capabilities of the existing workforce. rules, and tacit work, which involves applying judgment, creativity, and experience. Structured work Since AI agents will be embedded into the daily workflows of professionals and offers near-term potential for agents and can be aided by existing software tools for process mining and automatically combined with action taking, organizations will be positioned to documentation. Tacit work is harder to automate, but agentic AI may have a larger impact over time, realize greater workforce specialization and retention, higher trust in outcomes, and with several start-ups emerging to capture tacit work. The more work that can be codified now, the enhanced innovation. Agents promise to drive a 30 percent increase in workforce faster and greater the impact of agentic AI will be. In a recent KPMG AI Pulse Survey, 78 percent of efficiency and a 25 percent reduction in operational costs by 2027, according to a respondents said they would use agentic AI to analyze complex data sets, which requires tacit work, Harvard Business Review report. while 66 percent plan to employ agents for routine administrative tasks.13 Establishing systematic Organizations that adopt both GenAI and AI agents while concurrently dissecting and methods to capture and codify subject matter experts tacit knowledge to enable agents effectiveness reconstructing workforce roles will be more likely to realize significant productivity will become an operational necessity and will likely lead to competitive advantage. and capacity gains.
